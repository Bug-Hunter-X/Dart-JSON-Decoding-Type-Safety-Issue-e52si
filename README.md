# Dart JSON Decoding Type Safety

This example demonstrates a common issue in Dart when decoding JSON responses: type safety.  Incorrect type handling when parsing JSON can result in runtime errors if the JSON structure doesn't match the expected types in your Dart code.

The `bug.dart` file shows how to decode JSON data with potential type errors. The `bugSolution.dart` file shows a safer approach to handle various data structures within the JSON responses.
